## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Toyota Financial Services (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Actively contributed to high level and low level design of Identity Threat Detection and Response features, and leveraged concurrency patterns, ensuring clean code and delivering robust, scalable, and efficient architectures.
- Contributed to the WebSocket module in Go, replacing the previous primitive C++ implementation, to support millions of endpoints, reducing the number of containers to 1/4th, leveraging concurrency, heavily contributing to low-level design, and improving routing algorithm performance by 47%.
- Designed and developed a microservice to protect users against compromised credentials by utilizing  appropriate design patterns to ensure concurrency and scalability. It has the capability to detect breaches for 100k active directory users in a single scan.
- Explored rate limiting algorithms and architectures, and collaborated to create a service that throttles bursts of incoming events from endpoints and other sources exceeding the threshold, ensuring smooth traffic management and preventing system overload.
- Built IdP(Identity Provider) Connector service that triggers realtime push notifications for self-approval upon the execution of privileged commands and temporary access denial based on risk score, leveraging the robust access control capabilities of Azure, PingIdentity and Duo identity providers.
- Developed IoT and SCADA decoy containers in a Linux environment to deceive attackers, utilizing them as honeypots for enhanced deception-based security.
- Managed and automated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST), enhancing efficiency and ensuring security.
- Implemented opentelemetry metrics across Go, Python and C++ services in a distributed high traffic environment which helped in early detection of system anomalies. Additionally, created Grafana dashboards and alerts for realtime monitoring..
- \textbf{TechStack :} Go, Python, C++, AWS
    

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Built GraphQL and REST APIs to support querying, managing, and tracking the lifecycle of risks — defined as asset-
vulnerability correlations — across the platform.
- Implemented a high-performance CSV export feature to stream hundreds of thousands of risks and vulnerabilities via
HTTP response streaming; generated signed URLs for secure, time-limited access, and enforced per-user rate limiting
to control export frequency.
- Improved API performance by migrating from offset-based to cursor-based SQL pagination; introduced transactional
queries to ensure data consistency.
- TechStack : Go, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes
