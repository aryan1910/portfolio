## 💼 Experience

### 🧊 Arctic Wolf Networks (Apr 2025 – Present)  
**Developer | Go, PostgreSQL, AWS**

- Built GraphQL and REST APIs to support querying, managing, and tracking the lifecycle of risks (asset-vulnerability correlations).
- Implemented a high-performance CSV export feature using HTTP response streaming with secure, signed URLs and per-user rate limits.
- Improved API performance by migrating from offset-based to cursor-based pagination and adding transactional query support.

### 🛡️ SentinelOne (Sep 2021 – Mar 2025)  
**Software Engineer | Go, Python, C++, AWS**

- Contributed to **Identity Threat Detection and Response** features, leveraging concurrency patterns and clean code practices to build scalable and efficient architectures.
- Replaced the primitive C++ **WebSocket module** with a Go-based implementation that:
  - Supported **millions of endpoints**.
  - Reduced container count by **75%**.
  - Improved routing algorithm performance by **47%**.
- Designed and developed a **microservice** to detect compromised credentials, capable of scanning **100k Active Directory users** per run using concurrency-friendly patterns.
- Researched and implemented **rate-limiting algorithms** to throttle excessive event bursts from endpoints, improving system stability and preventing overloads.
- Built an **IdP Connector service** to push real-time self-approval notifications for privileged commands, temporarily deny access based on risk scores.
- Developed **IoT and SCADA decoy containers** (honeypots) in a Linux environment to enhance deception-based security.
- Automated **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** and **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** workflows for enhanced code security.
- Integrated **OpenTelemetry metrics** across distributed services in Go, Python, and C++, enabling ad early anomaly detection and real-time monitoring via custom Grafana dashboards and alerts.
